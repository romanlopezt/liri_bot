# liri-node-app
Week 10 (LIRI Bot) Assignment

Created during Week 10 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to use Node JS to create a LIRI bot, like iPhone's SIRI, but takes in command through Language vs Speech. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data based on one of four commands:

  * `my-tweets`

  * `spotify-this-song`

  * `movie-this`

  * `do-what-it-says`
